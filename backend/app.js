  return `St. Hilda's Secondary School will host the Biennial Service-Learning (SL) Symposium on 16 March 2025, Friday, from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM. The theme, **"Building Lives as ONE,"** focuses on unity, service, and leadership in community-building. The event begins with **registration and an environment showcase** at 2:00 PM, followed by the **Welcome Address** by the Principal at 3:00 PM. **Ix Shen**, the keynote speaker, will deliver his address at 3:10 PM, sharing insights from his humanitarian work in Ukraine. After a short break at 4:00 PM, participants will attend **one of four workshops** from 4:15 PM to 5:15 PM, with the symposium concluding with an **After-Action Review (AAR) and reflection** session. Ix Shen, a former Singaporean actor, gained recognition for his first-hand accounts of the **Russia-Ukraine war** while residing in Kyiv. He actively participated in **humanitarian aid efforts** and later published a memoir, *Impressions of an Invasion: A Correspondent in Ukraine* (2023). He also founded a **non-profit organization** to provide financial and medical aid to Ukrainian hospitals. His experiences offer valuable lessons on **resilience and community-building**, relevant to Singapore's **SG60 celebrations**. The symposium features **four concurrent workshops**, each designed to enhance participants' understanding of community engagement and sustainability. The first workshop, **"Beyond the Classroom: Cultivating Eco-Stewards Through Hands-On Learning and Service,"** is led by **St. Andrew's Secondary School**. It highlights their **Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP)**, which promotes environmental responsibility through **curriculum, culture, community, and campus initiatives**. It explores how **Values-in-Action (VIA)** integrates eco-stewardship into student activities, including **litter-picking, upcycling, and digital tools** like Google Lens and Padlet. Participants will also learn about **student-led environmental initiatives** such as the **Ang Pow Collection Drive** and **Project Eco Runway**. The second workshop, **"Reconnecting Youth to Nature,"** hosted by **Good Earth School**, focuses on reducing the negative effects of **digital overuse** by engaging students in **nature-based learning**. **Dr. Cynthia Wong** will discuss strategies to integrate nature into school curricula, aligning with **Singapore's Green Plan 2030**. Participants will explore **hands-on interventions** that promote environmental awareness, sustainability, and outdoor education. The third workshop, **"From Sympathy to Empathy: Facilitating Transformation for Students into Future Community Builders,"** is led by **Eugene Chua from SG Cares Volunteer Centre**. It examines how **VIA projects** shape students mindset from **sympathy to deep-rooted empathy**. The session emphasizes empowering students to take **ownership of community initiatives**, fostering **long-term engagement and social responsibility**. The fourth workshop, **"From Ideas to Impact â€“ Deep Diving into VIA,"** led by **Kelda Chua from Care Community Services Society**, introduces the **IPARD framework** for developing impactful VIA projects. Through **experiential learning and gamification**, participants will learn how to **identify community needs, create structured plans, and implement sustainable initiatives**. Alongside the workshops, the **Environment Showcase** will highlight sustainability efforts. Participants can engage in **plastic recycling with Semula Asia, urban and beach cleanups with Terra Academy, biodiversity education with The Good Earth School, and food security initiatives with Greenairy**. Attendees are encouraged to **bring plastic bottle caps** for recycling and redeem a **carabiner made from the recycled caps**. The symposium provides students and educators with an **enriching platform for collaboration, reflection, and action** in service-learning, environmental sustainability, and community engagement.`;
